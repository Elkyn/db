# Elkyn DB Test Coverage Report

## Test Structure Overview

The test structure follows the module organization in the `src/` directory, with each module having corresponding test files.

## Current Test Coverage

### ✅ Storage Module (`src/storage/`)
- **lmdb.zig** → `lmdb_test.zig` ✓
- **lmdb_cursor_test.zig** ✓ (cursor functionality)
- **tree.zig** → `tree_test.zig` ✓
- **storage.zig** → `storage_test.zig` ✓
  - Additional: `storage_cursor_test.zig` ✓
  - Additional: `storage_events_test.zig` ✓
  - Additional: `storage_update_test.zig` ✓
- **event_emitter.zig** → `event_emitter_test.zig` ✓
- **simple_events_test.zig** ✓ (integration tests)
- **value.zig** → `value_test.zig` ✓ (NEW)
- **mod.zig** - No tests needed (module exports only)

### ✅ Auth Module (`src/auth/`)
- **jwt.zig** → `jwt_test.zig` ✓
- **context.zig** → `context_test.zig` ✓ (NEW)

### ✅ Rules Module (`src/rules/`)
- **parser.zig** → `parser_test.zig` ✓
- **evaluator.zig** → `evaluator_test.zig` ✓
- **rule.zig** → `rule_test.zig` ✓ (NEW)
- **engine.zig** → `engine_test.zig` ✓ (NEW)
- **value_stub.zig** - No tests needed (test stub)

### ✅ API Module (`src/api/`)
- **simple_http_server.zig** → `simple_http_server_auth_test.zig` ✓

### ✅ Realtime Module (`src/realtime/`)
- **sse_manager.zig** → `sse_manager_test.zig` ✓ (NEW)

### ❌ Root Level Files (No tests needed)
- **main.zig** - Entry point, minimal logic
- **simple_server_main.zig** - Entry point, minimal logic
- **simple_thread_test.zig** - Already a test file
- **all_tests.zig** - Test aggregator

## Newly Created Test Files

1. **`src/storage/value_test.zig`**
   - Tests for Value type creation, serialization, deserialization, and cloning
   - Covers all value types: null, boolean, number, string, object, array
   - Tests memory management and cleanup

2. **`src/auth/context_test.zig`**
   - Tests for AuthContext initialization and methods
   - Tests authentication state, role checking, and memory cleanup

3. **`src/rules/rule_test.zig`**
   - Tests for Rule, PathRules, and RulesConfig structures
   - Tests rule creation, cleanup, and path variable handling
   - Tests wildcard detection in path patterns

4. **`src/rules/engine_test.zig`**
   - Tests for RulesEngine initialization and rule loading
   - Tests permission checking (read/write) with various rule configurations
   - Tests authentication-based and path-based access control

5. **`src/realtime/sse_manager_test.zig`**
   - Tests for SSE connection management
   - Tests event sending, heartbeats, and connection lifecycle
   - Includes mock implementations for testing network operations

## Test Organization

All tests are aggregated in `src/all_tests.zig` which:
- Imports all test files
- Ensures tests use correct relative imports
- Allows running all tests with `zig build test`

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
zig build test

# Run specific test file (from project root)
zig test src/storage/value_test.zig
zig test src/auth/context_test.zig
# etc.
```

## Test Guidelines (from CLAUDE.md)

- Write tests first (TDD approach)
- Every public function must have tests
- Test error cases explicitly
- Track allocations in performance-critical paths
- Use descriptive test names: "module: what it tests"
- Aim for 100% coverage

## Notes

- Some existing tests have memory leaks that need to be addressed
- Integration tests are run separately via `scripts/run_integration_tests.sh`
- Mock implementations are used for testing network and file operations where appropriate
